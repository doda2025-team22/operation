## Comments for A2
Other than the last task with is optional for this deadline, everything has been implemented. We included an additional playbook called `master.yaml` to call the other playbooks on the `Vagrantfile`. This is only done for convinience and cleaner code for the `Vagrantfile` and does not add additional complexities. Some of the `ansible.builtin.command` runs are also without checks present, this will be fixed on the final submission.
